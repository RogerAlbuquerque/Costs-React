## How to start the project:

1. First you need to open the terminal inside the project and type the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

2. Then, to start the project itself, you need to run the backend with the `npm run backend` command, and then the frontend with the `npm run dev` command.

3. After that the project is ready to run with a local backend using json-server.


# About the project

This is a project made with the intention of studying ReactJs and some more advanced packages and ideas.

This is a project that works with noting and organizing budgets for projects and services to carry out these projects. As it is for data storage, this project needs a backend, and for that the "json-server" package was used, which creates a "fake" database, but this database only works in a development environment , so the project that is seen by the github pages is hardcoded, and with the parts that manipulate the API commented.

This is not the final project, I intend to post it somewhere else at some point, but with a functional database in a production environment, I didn't do that right away because I still didn't have much knowledge of the backend, but now I know more about backend languages (php) and web servers, and soon I will be studying about express and node to complete this project using only tools that work with javascript.
